# FLOWFORGE
Flowforge is a productivity app that helps you focus.
When you open the app, you step into your own forge. As you work, your focus fuels the fire. When you drift, the forge cools. When you return, it reignites. You can see your attention take shape.
The app has two ways to work:
Timed Focus Mode if you like structure, like short, clear sessions with breaks.
Flow Mode if you prefer to work freely, guided by rhythm and energy rather than a timer.
Each session becomes part of what you create. The forge turns your focus into glowing elements, and over time, those elements merge into unique artifacts that are simple, visual symbols of your effort and balance.
